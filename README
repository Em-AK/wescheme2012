Build dependencies:

WeScheme runs on Google AppEngine 1.4.2.  Check out the repository,
and add it as a project within Eclipse.



WeScheme uses the Google Closure library:

   http://code.google.com/closure/library/docs/gettingstarted.html

to manage the dependencies between the JavaScript modules.  The
majority of these are located in:

   war-src/js

The script "build-console-and-editor.sh" should be executed after any
changes are made to the javascript source files in war-src/js.
