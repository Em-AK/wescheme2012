We make estimates based on previous usage, in particular blips where
our usage went past free limits.  I'm paying about $2.10 a week at the
moment.



According to AppEngine's logs, we do exceed these limits fairly
frequently.  Especially on:

2012-06-20
2012-06-21
2012-06-22
2012-06-14

On the week of 6/18-6-22, I paid $2.65.



On those days, the most significant costs were:

    frontend instance hours (around 40 hours)
    datastore reads (about half a million read requests)

Frontend instance hours being high means multiple AppEngine servers
needed to be spun up to support the load at that time, and corresponds
roughly with server load.  It contributes the highest amount (70%) of
our costs.  Datastore reads cover the next largest chunk of our costs
(28%).


On our worst day (2012-06-22), we used $1.19 out of our reserved
$2.00.
