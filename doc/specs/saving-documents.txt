When the user creates a new program, the project name field is empty.

---

When the user presses Save,  if the field is empty, a dialog box opens
up with the following note:

   Please provide a name for your program:
   [INPUT_BOX]  [Don't Save]  [Save]

where INPUT_BOX is a text field.

* If the user presses CANCEL, the dialog disappears and the save is aborted.

* If the user tries to press OK without entering anything in the
INPUT_BOX, the save is also aborted and a dialog says:

   Please provide a name for your program:
   (The name cannot be left blank.)
   [INPUT_BOX]  [Don't save]  [Save]

to allow the user another attempt to provide a program name.


Once a non-empty, non-whitespace name is provided and the user presses
OK, then WeScheme will normalize the name by trimming whitespace.  No
other normalization is applied to the program's name, and program
names are not meant to be uniquely identifying.

Once this is done, the program will be saved, and the name field in
the editor will be filled in.

---

If the name field is ever changed back to the empty string, no warning
shows up until the user tries to save the program, after which we
begin the name-getting interaction again.

---



Interaction with autosaving: Autosaving will still be active, even if
the name field is empty.  Programs can be autosaved without a title.

In the console, the program's name will display as "(No name)" so that
the user can still see that they've got a program without a name.
